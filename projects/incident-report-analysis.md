**Incident report analysis**

**Instructions**

As you continue through this course, you may use this template to record your findings after completing an activity or to take notes on what you've learned about a specific tool or concept. You can also use this chart as a way to practice applying the NIST framework to different situations you encounter.

| Summary | Earlier today, our internal network was compromised for two during a DDoS attack, specifically an ICMP flood. Our network stopped responding due to the flood of ICMP packets, and the normal internal network couldnâ€™t access any network resources. Our incident management team responded by blocking the incoming packets, halting all non-critical network services offline while restoring critical services. |
| :---- | :---- |
| Identify | It appears the malicious actor sent a flood of ICMP packets through an unconfigured firewall. This let the malicious actor overwhelm the network with a DDoS attack the whole network was shutdown and all users lost access. |
| Protect | The network security team implemented the following measures: A new rule to the firewall limiting the rate of the incoming ICMP packets. The use of an IDS/IPS system to filter out traffic with suspicious traits. |
| Detect | Checking for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets via source IP address verification on the firewall. Using a SIEM tool to monitor software and detect abnormal traffic patterns. |
| Respond | In the future, we will isolate affected system to minimize attack surface. We will use network logs to analyze log to check for abnormal activity. |
| Recover | Future attacks can be blocked by our reconfigured firewall. During this kind of attack, the goal is to restore normal network functionality. By stopping all non-critical network services offline we can reduce network traffic.  Restoring critical services is the first step followed by the rest. |
